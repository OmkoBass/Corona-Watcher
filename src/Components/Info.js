                    Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (also known as Wuhan Novel Coronavirus) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory
                    syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus closely related to the SARS virus. The disease first emerged in Wuhan,
                    China and is the cause of the 2019â€“20 coronavirus outbreak. Those affected are likely to develop a fever and dry cough.
